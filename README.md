# Back Of Your Hand

How well do you know your area? Test your knowledge by locating streets.

![Screenshots of the game; one narrow / mobile sized, one desktop sized. In one, the user is asked to find a particular street, but they haven't placed a marker / guess on the map yet. The other is an example where the result of a guess is being shown (i.e. the street is revealed and the distance is shown, etc.)](./public/images/combined-screenshots.png)

This is a map-based game I made for my dad for Christmas. You're given random street names and have to locate them on the map.
